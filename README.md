# Void_prediction
Friction stir welding (FSW) is a widely used technique in the manufacturing industry for joining materials with high strength and durability. However, the presence of voids in FSW can compromise the quality and integrity of the welds. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the presence of voids in FSW, allowing for early detection and preventive measures.

work Flow of Project:

1.Make the necessary imports.

2.Read the data into the data frame and get the shape of the data.

3.check The Shape of Data and check null values.

4.We have done EDA with the help of Mean and Median.

5.We check Mutual Information between independent and dependent variable with the help of mutual information gain.

6.we also plot the corelation Matrix with the help of pearson corelation.

7.we have done the feature selection on the basis of corelation matrix.

8.We apply train test split to avoid overfitting.

9.we compare different different model score, models like logistic regressin, Decision tree, RandomForest classifier.

10.we also make this model for metallographic features and check results of above models which is based on feature selection.
